            <p>The MAIA analytical tool allows to view, aggregate and extract ecosystem accounts. The data layer structure of the system is fully aligned with the SEEA EEA framework. 94 data layers from Bulgaria, France, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain are available in the system.</p>
            <p>
Ecosystem accounts statistics can be aggregated to several types of reports such as  a histogram, account table and extent matrix, exported in a workbook or PDF format. Data can be aggregated for predefined administrative units and custom spatial aggregations (self-drawn or imported polygons). </p>
